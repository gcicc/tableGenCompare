# Clinical Synthetic Data Generation Framework - GANerAide generalization

## Overview

First: read doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb and notebooks/clinical_synth_demo.ipynb
Second: to get understanding of typical columns in tables we'll work with look at 
liver_train.csv
Pakistani_Diabetes_Dataset.csv
Breast_cancer_data.csv

Critical: Read what is here first to understand what is intended. 

Goal: Create a new ipynb along the lines of doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb that will take in a .csv file.  Add placeholder sections for pre-processing.  Regarding the graphics and numeric summaries, I want to include the summaries used here: doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb and notebooks/clinical_synth_demo.ipynb but I want things organized effectively.
