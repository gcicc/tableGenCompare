# Clinical Synthetic Data Generation Framework - GANerAide generalization

## Overview

First: read doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb and doc/clinical_synth_demo.ipynb
Second: to get understanding of typical columns in tables we'll work with look at sample datasets in the /data folder
Third: Look at the structure of this current project and make changes as necessary to the file structure. 

Critical: Read what is here first to understand what is intended. 

Goal: Create a new ipynb along the lines of doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb that will take in a .csv file.  Add placeholder sections for pre-processing.  Regarding the graphics and numeric summaries, I want to include the summaries used here: doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb and notebooks/clinical_synth_demo.ipynb but I want things organized effectively.  Also, Let's make graphics and summaries simple along the lines of doc/GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb.  Consider small additions to code such as ability to optionally output figures and table summaries.

Phase 0:  Outline tasks needed to complete. Deliver to user the complement of visualizations and tables to be produced - broken down by EDA, similarity, accuracy, classification metrics etc.
Phase 1: Create a .ipynb file to work with Breast_cancer_data (essentially providing an update to GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb) 
Phase 2: Tailor changes and create a new .ipynb file for Pakistani_Diabetes_Dataset
Phase 3: Read C:\ForGit\PyTorchUltimateMaterial\GC-conditionalGAN\LiverCode2.ipynb with emphasis on preprocessing steps through One-Hot encoding of categorical data + MICE.  Build a new .ipynb file along the lines of our update to GANerAid_Demo_Notebook.ipynb, adding a section to address the pre-processing step
