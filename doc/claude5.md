0. Read this whole document to understand what we need to accomplish. We will then follow the step by step approach:

1. Read C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework.ipynb
2. Become aware of the structure of the document.
3. Appreciate that all models in section 3 ran successfully in demo mode.
4. Appreciate that all models in section 4 encountered errors that need to be fixed when we attempt hyperparameter optimization. Assign an agent to oversee a systematic review of code in each subsection's code and current output.  Desired Outcome is a section 4 where all hyperparameter optimization cells are functioning.  In particular note the following errors that need to be addressed. Review them first to see if there's a common causes or common solutions. Then let us work systematically to resolve CTGAN errors before moving to CTABGAN, etc.
    a. CTGAN failed: unsupported format string passed to tuple.__format__
        Pause here to commit and push to main when it runs properly.
    b. ERROR	src.models.implementations.ctabgan_model:ctabgan_model.py:train()- CTAB-GAN training failed: 'income'
     Pause here to commit and push to main when it runs properly.
    c. ERROR	src.models.implementations.ctabganplus_model:ctabganplus_model.py:train()- CTAB-GAN+ training failed: CTABGAN.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'general_columns'.         Pause here to commit and push to main when it runs properly.
    d. ERROR	src.models.implementations.ganeraid_model:ganeraid_model.py:train()- GANerAid training failed: index 20 is out of bounds for dimension 1 with size 20. Pause here to commit and push to main when it runs properly.
    e. GANerAid Parameter importance analysis has errors - but these may resolve if d. if fixed perhaps
    f. ERROR	src.models.implementations.copulagan_model:copulagan_model.py:train()- CopulaGAN training failed: 
    g. Additional errors are also thrown in CopulaGAN hyperparmater optimization section
            Pause here to commit and push to main when it runs properly.

    h. TVAE trial failed: unsupported format string passed to tuple.__format__

STOP! Let us pause here to ensure the notebook runs properly.  If so we will commit and push to main.


NEXT STEPS - not to be executed yet:
5.  Review section 3.1.1 regarding FUTURE DIRECTION. Brainstorm with user what is possible and we will first agree on complement of graphics and tables to use. While we are at it, let's also review section 4.1.1 where we'll similarly study the hyperparameter optimization process.

6.  Assign 3 agents: One works on developing a revised structure of the appendices to complement the work executed in the main sections of the document.  There should be sections that breifly introduce 1) each synthetic table generation method, 2) the choice of hyperparmeter space for each model along with rationale and tips for modifying in preparation for hyper parameter optimization, 3) a summary of the graphics and tables produced in section 3.1.1 with explanation of role in assessments.  4) a summary of the graphics and tables produced in section 4.1.1 with explanation of role in assessments.  Another critiques the work ensuring that descriptions are concise. A third oversees both to ensure they are working together towards a polished professional product.  

Have an agent review C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework.ipynb - look at each code chunk and ensure that each is preceded by a markdown chunk that breifly explains what the following code chunk is intended to accomplish.
