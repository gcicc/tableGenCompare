Have the functionality of these chunks:
CHUNK_041, CHUNK_043, CHUNK_045, CHUNK_047, CHUNK_049, CHUNK_051 - These should produce the same graphics and tables (preferably as data.frames) that are created in Section 4 on main - 
completed in batch along the lines of attack we used in CHUNK_018 with a batch run.

Remember that CHUNK_041, CHUNK_043, CHUNK_045, CHUNK_047, CHUNK_049, CHUNK_051 may have idiosyncracies that need to be considered as you create a batch function.

In the end these chunks will be removed and replaced with a single chunk along the lines of CHUNK_018, only it should be positioned at the end of section 4 after the final hyper parameter optimization exercise.
