# Section 5: Final Model Comparison and Best-of-Best Selection

## Overview

Section 5 represents the culmination of our comprehensive synthetic data generation framework. After optimizing hyperparameters for all 6 models in Section 4, we now conduct final evaluations using the best-performing configurations to identify the optimal model for clinical synthetic data generation.

## Methodology

Each model undergoes identical evaluation using its optimized hyperparameters from Section 4:
- **CTGAN** (Conditional Tabular GAN)
- **CTAB-GAN** (Conditional Tabular GAN with advanced preprocessing)
- **CTAB-GAN+** (Enhanced version with WGAN-GP losses)
- **GANerAid** (Custom LSTM-based implementation)
- **CopulaGAN** (Copula-based GAN)
- **TVAE** (Tabular Variational Autoencoder)

- **Cross-Validation Ratios**: TSTR/TRTR, TSTS/TRTR, TRTS/TRTR comparisons
- **Training Efficiency**: Training time, computational requirements
- **Hyperparameter Stability**: Optimization convergence, parameter sensitivity

### 5.7.2 Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
Structured approach to model selection using weighted scoring:

**Evaluation Criteria Categories:**

1. **Statistical Fidelity (Weight: 25%)**
   - **Univariate Similarity**: Earth Mover's Distance (EMD/Wasserstein distance) for all numeric columns
     - Formula: `1 / (1 + EMD_score)` (converted to similarity score)
     - Applied to each numeric column excluding target
   - **Bivariate Similarity**: Correlation Matrix Distance
     - Flatten correlation matrices using upper triangle indices
     - Calculate: `1 - mean(abs(real_corr_flat - synth_corr_flat))`
   - **Final Statistical Score**: Mean of all univariate and correlation similarity scores
   

2. **Classification Performance (Weight: 40%)**
   - **TRTS Framework**: Train Real, Test Synthetic evaluation using RandomForest
     - Model: RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
     - Training: Fit on real data with all features except target
     - Testing: Evaluate on synthetic data
     - Metric: Classification accuracy score
   - **Implementation**: Direct match to Section 4's enhanced_objective_function_v2
   - **Weight Justification**: Emphasizes practical utility of synthetic data for downstream tasks

**Final Combined Score**: 
- Formula: `0.6 * statistical_fidelity + 0.4 * classification_performance`
- Matches Section 4's enhanced_objective_function_v2 exactly

**Additional Evaluation Criteria** (for comprehensive analysis but not primary scoring):

3. **Generalization Capability**
   - TSTR performance (synthetic→real generalization) 
   - Cross-validation stability (variance across folds)
   - Out-of-sample performance consistency

4. **Data Utility**
   - TRTS/TRTR ratio (real model performance on synthetic test data)
   - Privacy preservation vs utility trade-off
   - Edge case handling (rare class performance)
