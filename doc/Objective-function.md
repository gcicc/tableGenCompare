### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `enhanced_objective_function_v2` takes several parameters:
     - `real_data`: The original dataset.
     - `synthetic_data`: The dataset generated by the synthetic data generation model.
     - `target_column`: The name of the target variable (dependent variable) for evaluation.
     - `similarity_weight` and `accuracy_weight`: Weights to determine the influence of similarity versus accuracy in the final score.

2. **Target Column Validation**:
   - The function first checks if the `target_column` exists in both the `real_data` and `synthetic_data`. If not, it outputs a warning and returns zero scores.

3. **Similarity Component (60%)**:
   - **Univariate Similarity**:
     - For each numeric column (except the target column), it calculates the Earth Moverâ€™s Distance (EMD) as a measure of similarity. EMD quantifies the distance between two probability distributions.
     - The similarity score is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 + \text{emd\_score}} \).

   - **Correlation Similarity**:
     - It calculates the correlation between the numeric features of both datasets, computing the distance in their correlation matrices. The mean absolute difference is used to derive a correlation similarity score.

4. **Accuracy Component (40%)**:
   - Using the TRTS (Train on Real, Test on Synthetic) approach:
     - The function prepares the features and targets for both datasets and ensures they have matching columns.
     - It trains a RandomForestClassifier on the real data and tests it on the synthetic data, recording the accuracy.
     - It also trains the model on the synthetic data and tests it on the real data, again capturing the accuracy.
     - The average accuracy from both tests is calculated.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final combined score is computed using the similarity and accuracy scores weighted by their respective weights.
   - Finally, the function prints out the scores and returns the combined score, similarity score, and accuracy score.

### Summary of Purpose:
The goal of this function is to provide a robust evaluation of synthetic data by assessing how similar it is to real data (using both univariate and correlation metrics) while also measuring how accurately predictive models can distinguish between real and synthetic data. By incorporating a target column dynamically, it allows flexibility across different datasets.
