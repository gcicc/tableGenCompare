We are working to generalize: C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework.ipynb

1.  Read the file.  Note that it is bringing in data/Breast_cancer_data.csv.
2. Note there are 3 other .csv files.  Each data set is rectangual. Each data set has different number of rows, different columns, different combinations of categorical and numeric variables. Each, however, has a target endpoint.  More generally, we might anticipate datasets coming in along similar lines, most of which will have a target endpoint along with other covariates.
3.  Identify the list of tasks that would be needed in order to generalize the existing code to handle generic incoming datasets. Addiitonally, review C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\notebooks\clinical_synth_demo.ipynb and note that we will have need to assess missingness in this data set and then I'd like to employ MICE.
