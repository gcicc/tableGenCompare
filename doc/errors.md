We are focusing on the errors found in C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework_Generalized.ipynb

FIRST read the entire notebook to understand the code dependencies. 

We will focus on one error at a time.  But as you approach your solutions note that code in sections 1, 2, 3 and section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 are working as expected. We are considering output from Section 4.4
