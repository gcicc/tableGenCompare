We are focusing on the errors found in C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework_Generalized.ipynb

FIRST read the entire notebook to understand the code dependencies. 

We will focus on one error at a time.  But as you approach your solutions note that code in sections 1, 2, 3 are working as expected except for CTAB-GAN+ in section 3.3.  

Note we are expecting:

Histograms as in previous sections

# Code to send summary graphics and tables to file for CTAB-GAN model
# Using the reusable evaluate_synthetic_data_quality function from section 3.1.1
# INSERT CODE HERE - expecting output similar to evaluate_synthetic_data_quality 

And PCA plots as in previous sections
# Insert code - expecing PCA output
# ============================================================================
# SECTION 3.3 STANDARD PCA COMPARISON - CTAB-GAN+
# Real vs Synthetic Data Principal Component Analysis (Side-by-Side)
# ============================================================================

Focus on resolving the incompleted code chunks in 3.3 being mindful of the impact any changes might have on other subsections of section 3 - I expect everything in section 3 to run without fail.  Use an agent to ensure that CTGAN+ is running properly and leverage information at https://github.com/Team-TUD/CTAB-GAN-Plus as needed.
