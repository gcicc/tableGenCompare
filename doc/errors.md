We are focusing on the errors found in C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework_Generalized.ipynb

FIRST read the entire notebook to understand the code dependencies. In particular, note that in section 2, we are trying to develop a holistic data import process. So keep this in mind when coding solutions in Section 4.

Section 4.  Assign an agent to oversee the correction of this code.
