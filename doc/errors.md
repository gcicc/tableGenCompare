We are focusing on the errors found in C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\Clinical_Synthetic_Data_Generation_Framework_Generalized.ipynb

FIRST read the entire notebook to understand the code dependencies. 

We will focus on one error at a time.  But as you approach your solutions note that code in sections 1, 2, 3 and section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 are working as expected. We are considering output from Section 4.4 and Section 4.5

In Section 4.4, note that each of the trials return value of 0. This indicates, something is amiss.

[I 2025-08-25 19:36:16,808] Trial 2 finished with value: 0.0 and parameters: {'batch_size': 100, 'nr_of_rows': 45, 'epochs': 100, 'lr_d': 3.994239193939106e-06, 'lr_g': 0.0007164148952056379, 'hidden_feature_space': 600, 'binary_noise': 0.22963248633504024, 'generator_decay': 3.588298425956322e-08, 'discriminator_decay': 0.00021273033254602498, 'dropout_generator': 0.09636107511579584, 'dropout_discriminator': 0.15667036773705656}. Best is trial 0 with value: 0.0.

(Let's increase the number of trials to 5 as we troubleshoot)

In Section 4.5:
