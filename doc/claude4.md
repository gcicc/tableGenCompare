5. **Final Notebook Renaming**: Choose production-ready name


AGENT INTRODUCED: An agent who has read claude3.md is assigned to ensure work stays true to the intent of the referenced notebooks in that file as they seem to have been not included in claude4.md.  Particularly, hyperparameter space definitions.  With regard to tables and graphcis, let this agent ensure that we have complete reports without duplication and proper referencing to filenames in the notebook.  Also, this agent ensures that titles and displays are aesthetically pleasing.


**Commit Point**: Production-ready notebook with comprehensive documentation

## **PHASE 4: GENERALIZATION FRAMEWORK**
### Core Requirements (Must Complete)
1. **Alzheimer's Dataset Implementation**: Create alzheimers_disease_multi_model_analysis.ipynb
2. **Dataset-Agnostic Framework**: Generalize data loading and preprocessing sections
3. **User Guidance Integration**: Prompts for dataset-specific configuration
4. **Validation Testing**: Verify hyperparameter spaces work across different data types

### Enhancement Options (Choose As Desired)
- **D1**: Automatic dataset characterization (size, complexity, feature types)
- **D2**: Adaptive hyperparameter space selection based on dataset properties
- **D3**: Cross-dataset performance comparison framework
- **D4**: Dataset preprocessing recommendation engine

**Commit Point**: Generalized framework validated on multiple datasets

## **PHASE 5: ADDITIONAL DATASETS & SCALABILITY**
### Core Requirements (Must Complete)
1. **Remaining CSV Implementation**: Process all datasets in /data folder
2. **Performance Validation**: Ensure framework scales across dataset diversity
3. **Repository Cleanup**: Remove superfluous files from branch

### Enhancement Options (Choose As Desired)

## **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### Objective Function Enhancement
```python
# Core Implementation (Required)
def enhanced_objective_function(similarity_score, accuracy_score, weights=(0.6, 0.4)):
    return weights[0] * similarity_score + weights[1] * accuracy_score

# Optional Enhancement A1
def configurable_objective_function(similarity_score, accuracy_score, 
                                  similarity_weight=0.6, accuracy_weight=0.4):
    total_weight = similarity_weight + accuracy_weight
    normalized_sim = similarity_weight / total_weight
    normalized_acc = accuracy_weight / total_weight
    return normalized_sim * similarity_score + normalized_acc * accuracy_score
```

### Hyperparameter Space Design
```python
# Core Implementation (Required)
hyperparameter_spaces = {
    'CTGAN': get_comprehensive_ctgan_space(),
    'TVAE': get_comprehensive_tvae_space(),
    # ... other models
}

# Optional Enhancement D2
def adaptive_hyperparameter_space(dataset_characteristics):
    if dataset_characteristics['size'] < 1000:
        return get_small_dataset_space()
    elif dataset_characteristics['complexity'] > 0.8:
        return get_complex_dataset_space()
    # ... adaptive logic

## **IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

1. **Start with Core Requirements**: Build solid foundation before enhancements
2. **Iterative Enhancement**: Add optional features based on results and feedback
3. **Commit Frequently**: Each phase completion provides stable checkpoint
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate each enhancement doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Document Decisions**: Track which enhancements were implemented and why
