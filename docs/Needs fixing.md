We are fixing errors in Section 4 of these notebooks. Let's underscore that sections are developed in a common fashion across notebooks.  Main difference is just in the data set that used.  Note that Section 3 runs 6 demos of synthetic data generation models. Section 4 is simply performing hyperparameter opimization.  

Corrections should be made in setup.py when possible so notebooks are as similar as possible in sections 3,4, 5.

Note that section 2 loads the data, performs multiple imputation and then samples 5000 rows from that imputed data set.  So in the liver notebook below, it would appear that the wrong dataset is being used.  Consider what was done in C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\SynthethicTableGenerator-Pakistani.ipynb to ensure this dataset was employed and see if that fix should be applied across the rest of the note books.

The data set used in Section 3 and Section 4 should be the dataset formed and sampled from following MICE imputation section. Therefore there should be no missing values in the dataset used in Section 3 and 4.
