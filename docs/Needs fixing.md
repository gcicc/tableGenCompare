We are fixing errors in Section 4 of these notebooks. Let's underscore that sections are developed in a common fashion across notebooks.  Main difference is just in the data set that used.  Note that Section 3 runs 6 demos of synthetic data generation models. Section 4 is simply performing hyperparameter opimization.  

The github for ganeraid is:https://github.com/TeamGenerAid/GANerAid

Corrections should be made in setup.py when possible so notebooks are as similar as possible in sections 3,4, 5.

## Files Affected
- `C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\SynthethicTableGenerator-Alzheimer.ipynb`

All working as expected to end of section 4 and produced all output as expected. 


- `C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\SynthethicTableGenerator-BreastCancer.ipynb`
All working as expected to end of section 4 and produced all output as expected. 



- `C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\SynthethicTableGenerator-Liver.ipynb`
✅ FIXED: All Section 4 hyperparameter optimization chunks now explicitly load clean `data/liver_train_subset.csv` with 0 missing values
✅ FIXED: Added data validation checks to ensure no missing values before starting optimization
✅ FIXED: Root cause was data flow inconsistency - Section 4 was using raw data instead of clean, imputed subset from Section 2



- `C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\SynthethicTableGenerator-Pakistani.ipynb`
All working as expected to end of section 4 and produced all output as expected.
