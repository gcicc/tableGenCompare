Each of these notebooks identified below are running fine and producing output as expected.

1. read setup.py
2. read C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\tableGenCompare\SynthethicTableGenerator-Alzheimer.ipynb to get an general understanding of what the notebooks set out to accomplish.  
3. Note that each notebook is experiencing some error in CHUNK_070
4. CHUNK_070 should be simply rerunning a fit of CouplaGAN using the best hyperparameters identified in Section 4's CouplaGAN subsection.  You should examine how other Subsections of section 5 leverage the information from their respective subsections of section 4.  Note that in Section 5 we simply repeat the displays/tables/figures created along the lines of section.
5.  Note how section 5.2 creates batch processing, so the fix to CHUNK_070 needs to ensure that its output is ready for 5.2

WE ARE NEARLY FINISHED.  LEt's fix these final errors:

Note: If creation of synthentic data was successful in section 3.  It should be successful in section 5!
